Carousel is a prototyping tool powered by Framer Library. It aims to provide a simple way to build large-scale prototypes with multiple files on both Mac and Windows. This is the first application that runs Framer on the Windows platform.

Carousel does not feature a Design-mode, which means that your prototypes are made only using the Framer Library API. Projects may be written in JavaScript (ES6) or CoffeeScript.

All projects comes pre-packaged with a few handy Framer Modules:
- Framer Joystick
- Framer Form

### Important Notice
Code Signing Certificates have not yet been integrated with the builds for neither Windows or macOS. This means that both Windows and macOS (and probably a couple of anti-virus programs) will flag the Carousel installer as untrusted. Carousel will however run fine if you proceed despite the warnings.

This is of course on our radar, and we'll hopefully have certificates integrated with builds on both platforms soon.
