Carousel is a prototyping tool powered by an excellent prototyping framework known as [Framer Library](https://github.com/koenbok/Framer). It aims to provide a simple way to build large-scale, Gamepad-driven prototypes with multiple files on both Mac and Windows. This is the first application that runs Framer on the Windows platform.

Carousel does not feature a Design-mode, which means that your prototypes are made only using the Framer Library API. Projects may be written in JavaScript (ES6) or CoffeeScript.

### Download
You can find download-links for the latest release [here](https://github.com/emilwidlund/carousel/releases/latest). If you'd like to see all releases, you can find them [here](https://github.com/emilwidlund/carousel/releases).  
Download the .dmg file for macOS or the .exe file for Windows.

#### Important Notice
Code Signing Certificates has not yet been integrated with the builds for neither Windows or macOS. This means that both Windows and macOS (and probably a couple of anti-virus programs) will flag the Carousel installer as untrusted. Carousel will however run fine if you proceed despite the warnings.

This is of course on our radar, and we'll hopefully have certificates integrated with builds on both platforms soon.
