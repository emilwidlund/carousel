Carousel is a prototyping tool powered by Framer Library. It aims to provide a simple way to build large-scale prototypes with multiple files on both Mac and Windows. This is the first application that runs Framer on the Windows platform.

Carousel does not feature a Design-mode, which means that your prototypes are made only using the Framer Library API. Projects may be written in JavaScript (ES6) or CoffeeScript.

All projects comes pre-packaged with a few handy Framer Modules:
- Framer Joystick
- Framer Form
